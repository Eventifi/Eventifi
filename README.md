Eventify (tm) is an application (web/mobile) that helps bring people together by means of events. Eventify uses Google Maps to show locations where events are taking place.
Each marker on the map is labeled with the event title, and clicking on it allows you to see the date, location, etc. The sidebar on the left allows you to navigate around the app's functions, 
such as creating events, viewing events, and accessing the main map. 

Eventify was built by Sahith Malyala, Anuraag Yachamaneni, Shrey Gupta, and Colin Chen. 

We would like to thank Oak Chantosa and Gabe Boning for greatly helping us build this application!
