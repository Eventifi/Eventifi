Eventify™ is a web and mobile application utilizing Google Maps to help bring people together.

Eventify™ uses Google Maps to show nearby locations where events are taking place. Each marker on the map is labeled with the event title, and clicking on it allows you to see the date, location, etc. The sidebar on the left allows you to navigate around the app's functions, including creating events, viewing events, and accessing the main map.

Eventify was built by Sahith Malyala, Anuraag Yachamaneni, Shrey Gupta, and Colin Chen. 

We would like to thank Oak Chantosa and Gabe Boning for helping us build this application!
