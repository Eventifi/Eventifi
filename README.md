Eventify™ is a web and mobile application utilizing Google Maps to help bring people together.

Eventify™ uses Google Maps to show nearby locations where events are taking place. Each marker on the map is labeled with the event title, and clicking on it allows you to see the date, location, etc. The sidebar on the left allows you to navigate around the app's functions, including creating events, viewing events, and accessing the main map.

If you’re bored and don’t have anything to do, Eventify is for you! Want to start a basketball game with your friends or anybody else? Use Eventify to create a basketball game at your local gym or court so that others can join you – in 1 hour or in 1 year!

If you are new to a place, eventify helps you find events near you to attend easily, so you don't spend most of your time in that boring old hotel room watching tv.


Eventify was built by Sahith Malyala, Anuraag Yachamaneni, Shrey Gupta, and Colin Chen. 

We would like to thank Oak Chantosa, Gabe Boning, and Peter Andringa for helping us build this application!
